Bonus Points:

a. For 1 ms ticks, the baseline power consumption is 33 mW.
	For 10 ms ticks, the baseline power consumption is 32 mW.
	For 100 ms ticks, the baseline power consumption is 32 mW.
	For 200 ms ticks, the baseline power consumption is 31 mW. 
	In my implementation, there does not seem to be a great difference in power consumption if the systick 
	period is changed. A shorter timer interrupt gives the system more granularity and precision in timing
	when tasks are short.

b. The capsense circuit has up to 64 port pins (linked to capacitors) which convert 
	capacitive signal to digital outputs. The port pins can be linked together to 
	measure combined capacitance of the many capacitors used to measure finger contact. The 64
	port pins are arranged on top of 4 buttons, each of which registers when one or a set of 
	port pins on it is activated. The capacitive port pins measure fine detail and the buttons
	can be accessed to find which regions of the capacitive sensor are pressed on a larger scale.
