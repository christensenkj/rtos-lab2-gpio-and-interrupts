Measurements

IRQ
a.   Measure the baseline power consumption in mW when no buttons are pressed and no finger is placed on the touch slider.
3.33 mW

b.   Control the LEDs with each pushbutton and record the power consumption in mW when each LED is lit.
LED0: 5.18 mW
LED1: 5.18 mW

c.    Control the LEDs with the touch slider and record the power consumption in mW when each LED is lit.
LED0: 4.89 mW
LED1: 4.90 mW

d.   Light both LEDs using a combination of pushbuttons and the touch slider and record the power consumption in mW.
Both LEDs using PB0 and slider RIGHT: 6.73 mW
Both LEDs using PB1 and slider LEFT: 6.73 mW

e.   Use the compile-time switch to build, run, and compare the power consumption for the polling method in Part I versus the interrupt-driven method in Part II.


Polling
a.   Measure the baseline power consumption in mW when no buttons are pressed and no finger is placed on the touch slider.

b.   Control the LEDs with each pushbutton and record the power consumption in mW when each LED is lit.
LED0: 8.55 mW
LED1: 8.56 mW

c.    Control the LEDs with the touch slider and record the power consumption in mW when each LED is lit.
LED0: 8.27 mW
LED1: 8.28 mW

d.   Light both LEDs using a combination of pushbuttons and the touch slider and record the power consumption in mW.
Both LEDs using PB0 and slider RIGHT: 10.11 mW
Both LEDs using PB1 and slider LEFT: 10.09 mW

Reduced Systick Frequency
f.For the interrupt-driven method, reduce the frequency of the SysTick timer and compare the baseline power consumption.
10 ms tick: 3.32 mW
100 ms tick: 3.32 mW
200 ms tick: 3.31 mW
